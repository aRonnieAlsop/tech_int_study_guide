        <strong>When to Use Stacks:</strong> Stacks are ideal for problems that require backtracking or require access to the most recent item added. They follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed.

        <h2>When to Use:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Undo Operations:</strong> Stacks are often used in text editors for undo operations, where the most recent change is the first one to be undone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expression Evaluation:</strong> Stacks are used for parsing and evaluating expressions, especially when working with parentheses or operators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> DFS in tree or graph traversal is often implemented using stacks, either explicitly or via the call stack during recursion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Function Calls (Call Stack):</strong> A stack is used to store function calls, and each time a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the stack.
          </li>
